## Folder structure
### Needed on Distribution / Live
```
|- /dist
```
Only the contents of the `dist` folder are needed for production.

### Needed for Development / Local
```
*.* (All project's files)
```

## IDE tools, ESLint
This boilerplate comes with these files on root:
- .editorconfig
- .eslintrc.json
- .eslintignore

 Your IDE might need some plugins to be installed in order to recognize those files. You can change the rules/configuration on these files based on your project needs.

## Environments
- Local aka dev.
  - webpack mode: 'development'.
  - _cdnPublicFolder.scss is loaded from './src/common/sass/cdnPublicFolder/dev', "cdnFile" sass mixin and returns: ''.

- Production aka live.
  - webpack mode: 'production'.
  - _cdnPublicFolder.scss is loaded from './src/common/sass/cdnPublicFolder/live', "cdnFile" sass mixin and returns: ''.

Concept:

  2. [CDN public urls on scss](#CDN-public-urls-on-scss)

## CDN public urls on scss
If your website uses CDNs for the images, css might require different urls per
environment. For example an image preloader could have this url on development environment:

```scss
.preloader {
  background: transparent url("/img/ajax-loader.gif") no-repeat center center;
}
```
This on testing and live environment:
```scss
.preloader {
  background: transparent url("/_commonFiles/img/ajax-loader.gif") no-repeat center center;
}
```

For this purpose for each environment we will create a sass mixin `cdnFile` and use that instead of the `url` rule.

```scss
@import "_cdnPublicFolder.scss";

.preloader {
  background: transparent cdnFile("/img/ajax-loader.gif") no-repeat center center;
}
```

Edit these folders/files:
```
|- /src
  |- /sass
    |- /cdnPublicFolder
      |- /dev
        |- _cdnPublicFolder.scss
      |- /live
        |- _cdnPublicFolder.scss
```

`./src/sass/cdnPublicFolder/dev/_cdnPublicFolder.scss` contents:
```scss
// For Development environment.
$commonFileBasePath: '';

@function cdnFile($file) {
  @return url($commonFileBasePath + $file);
}
```

`./src/sass/cdnPublicFolder/live/_cdnPublicFolder.scss` contents:
```scss
// For Live environment.
$commonFileBasePath: '/_commonFiles';

@function cdnFile($file) {
  @return url($commonFileBasePath + $file);
}
```

## Demo page / Installation
1. Fork/ Download this project
2. [Install Nodejs/NPM](#Install-Nodejs/NPM) (Skip this if you already have nodejs installed)
3. From the project's root run:
```
  npm install
```
4. Start development..
```
  npm run watch
  npm run live-reload
```

Or build the bundle for live and open `dist/index.html` on your browser.
```
  npm run build:live
```

## NPM tasks
Watch files for changes and rebuild app:
```
npm run watch
```

Opens app on your default Browser and reloads page on changes.
```
npm run live-reload
```

Build the app for local development:
```
npm run build
```

Build the app for the production server:
```
npm run build:live
```

Make a bundle and view the stats:
```
npm run bundle-stats
```
Also creates a `bundle-stats.json` file.
